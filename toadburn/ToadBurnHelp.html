<h1>Toad Burn</h1>
<p>By Yen Lee Loh and Isaac Hutchison (November 2025) </p>

<!-- ############################ -->
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Toad Burn is an educational browser-based puzzle game that aims to introduce digital logic and sequential logic in a fun way. </p>

<!-- ############################ -->
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Toad Burn consists of a series of levels.  
Each level takes the form of a finite grid of squares (cells).
The player (Mario) can perform various actions including walking, toggling switches, and placing lava, water, or toads.
("Water squares" may eventually be replaced by "trench squares".)
The objective of each level is to defeat the enemy (Bowser) by flooding his square with lava.
Mario is not able to attack Bowser directly.  Instead, he must use logic and ingenuity to channel lava into Bowser's square.
Mario must also avoid flooding Princess Peach with lava!  If Peach gets burned, the level is lost and must be restarted.
</p>

<p>Toad Logic plays a central role in the game.
A cell may be occupied by a toad.
If the cells to the north, south, and west are lava-free, the toad is in the "Happy" state, and spews lava toward the east.
If any of the three cells to the north, south, and west have lava, 
this causes the toad to be in the "Crying" state, and emits water instead.
</p>

<p>Depending on how many input cells (N, S, or W) are active, 
    a toad corresponds to a NOT, NOR, or 3-way NOR gate in digital electronics.
</p>

<p>Ordinarily, lava (and water) can spread in all directions.  
If a cell has 3 or 4 neighbors, it functions as a splitter or merge point.
However, if <em>grade separation</em> is enabled on a cell, 
lava (or water) flows along two separate channels in the East-West and North-South directions.
This allows the player (or level designer) to route wires across each other without signal interference.
This is necessary for creating complex circuits.
</p>


<p>Stars are the equivalent of lamps or LEDs in electronics.
They merely indicate ON/OFF state at key points in the circuit, with no impact on circuit behavior or gameplay.
</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<p> Default keybindings are as follows.</p>
<div class="table">
    <div class="cell1">Go north </div>
    <div class="cell2">&#8593; or I </div>
    <div class="cell1">Go south </div>
    <div class="cell2">&#8595; or &lt;</div>
    <div class="cell1">Go west </div>
    <div class="cell2">&#8592; or J </div>
    <div class="cell1">Go east </div>
    <div class="cell2">&#8594; or L </div>
    <div class="cell1">Place lava </div>
    <div class="cell2">1 or U </div>
    <div class="cell1">Place water </div>
    <div class="cell2">1 or U </div>
    <div class="cell1">Place toad </div>
    <div class="cell2">3 or M </div>
    <div class="cell1">Place grass </div>
    <div class="cell2">&grave; or $gt; </div>
    <div class="cell1">Reset level </div>
    <div class="cell2">Shift-R </div>
    <div class="cell1">Go to previous level </div>
    <div class="cell2">[ </div>
    <div class="cell1">Go to next level </div>
    <div class="cell2">] </div>
    <div class="cell1">Enter cheat mode </div>
    <div class="cell2">Shift-C </div>
</div>


<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
The circuit dynamics is modeled as a finite-state cellular automaton.
The state of each cell depends only on the states of five cells (Center, East, West, North, and South) at the previous timestep.
The state of a cell has several possible values:
<div class="table">
    <div class="cell1">Empty </div><div class="cell2">0</div>
    <div class="cell1">Cold, contagious </div><div class="cell2">1</div>
    <div class="cell1">Cold, recovering </div><div class="cell2">2</div>
    <div class="cell1">Cold, dormant    </div><div class="cell2">3</div>
    <div class="cell1">Hot, contagious  </div><div class="cell2">7</div>
    <div class="cell1">Hot, recovering  </div><div class="cell2">6</div>
    <div class="cell1">Hot, dormant     </div><div class="cell2">5</div>
    <div class="cell1">Toad, crying     </div><div class="cell2">4?</div>
    <div class="cell1">Toad, happy      </div><div class="cell2">8?</div>
</div>
</p>
Imagine that there are two kinds of viruses, hot and cold.  
If a cell is contagious, on the next timestep it will enter recovery.
If a cell is recovering, it cannot be re-infected, and on the next timestep the virus will become dormant 
(although the cell is still a carrier of that type of virus).
If a cell is dormant, it can be infected by EITHER type of virus if an adjacent cell is contagious.
These rules allow unidirectional pulse propagation in either direction along a row of cells.

A toad is a NOR gate.


A set of digital logic gates can be represented by a binary cellular automaton with custom rules for each gate
